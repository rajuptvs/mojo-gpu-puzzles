## How to Use This Book

Each puzzle maintains a consistent structure to support systematic skill development:

- **Overview**: Problem definition and key concepts for each challenge
- **Configuration**: Technical setup and memory organization details
- **Code to Complete**: Implementation framework in `problems/pXX/` with clearly marked sections to fill in
- **Tips**: Strategic hints available when needed, without revealing complete solutions
- **Solution**: Comprehensive implementation analysis, including performance considerations and conceptual explanations

The puzzles increase in complexity systematically, building new concepts on established foundations. Working through them sequentially is recommended, as advanced puzzles assume familiarity with concepts from earlier challenges.

## Running the code

All puzzles integrate with a testing framework that validates implementations against expected results. Each puzzle provides specific execution instructions and solution verification procedures.

## Prerequisites

### System requirements

Make sure your system meets our [system requirements](https://docs.modular.com/max/packages#system-requirements).

### Compatible GPU

You'll need a [compatible GPU](https://docs.modular.com/max/faq#gpu-requirements) to run the puzzles. After setup, you can verify your GPU compatibility using the `gpu-specs` command (see Quick Start section below).

#### macOS Apple Sillicon (Early preview)

For `osx-arm64` users, you'll need:

- **macOS 15.0 or later** for optimal compatibility. Run `pixi run check-macos` and if it fails you'd need to upgrade.
- **Xcode 16 or later** (minimum required). Use `xcodebuild -version` to check.

If `xcrun -sdk macosx metal` outputs `cannot execute tool 'metal' due to missing Metal toolchain` proceed by running

```bash
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain
```

and then `xcrun -sdk macosx metal`, should give you the `no input files error`.

> **Note**: Currently the puzzles 1-8 and 11-15 are working on macOS. We're working to enable more. Please stay tuned!

### Programming knowledge

Basic knowledge of:

- Programming fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)
- Parallel computing concepts (threads, synchronization, race conditions)
- Basic familiarity with [Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/) (language basics parts and [intro to pointers](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/pointers/) section)
- [GPU programming fundamentals](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/gpu/fundamentals) is helpful!

No prior GPU programming experience is necessary! We'll build that knowledge through the puzzles.

Let's begin our journey into the exciting world of GPU computing with Mojo🔥!

    - Full conda + PyPI ecosystem support

    > **Note: Some puzzles only work with `pixi`**

    **Install:**

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
    ```

    **Update:**

    ```bash
    pixi self-update
    ```

   #### **Option 2**: [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

    **Install:**

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    **Update:**

    ```bash
    uv self update
    ```

    **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Verify setup and run your first puzzle:**

## Working with puzzles

### Project structure

- **[`problems/`](https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles/tree/main/problems)**: Where you implement your solutions (this is where you work!)
- **[`solutions/`](https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles/tree/main/solutions)**: Reference solutions for comparison and learning that we use throughout the book

### Workflow

1. Navigate to `problems/pXX/` to find the puzzle template
2. Implement your solution in the provided framework
3. Test your implementation: `pixi run pXX` or `uv run poe pXX` (remember to include your platform with `-e platform` such as `-e amd`)
4. Compare with `solutions/pXX/` to learn different approaches

### Essential commands
